# Tesla Gigafactory Texas (Feb 9, 2026)

**Date:** Feb 9, 2026  
**Contact:** Bill Palmer (Controls Design Engineering Lead, Gigafactory Texas)  
**Introducer:** Nicholas Palmer (LinkedIn)  
**Attendees:** Bill + additional Tesla team  
**Outcome:** 🔥 Major OEM opportunity, follow-up scheduled

---

## Company Context

**Location:** Gigafactory Texas (Austin area)

**Current procurement:** Vendor-locked (only approved registered vendors)

**Challenge:** Need flexible panel design + quoting for custom projects

---

## Blitzpanel Demo Reaction

**What they saw:**
1. UL508A/UL698A shop credentials
2. Web-based design app (alpha)
3. Component library (Wago, Phoenix Contact, Siemens)
4. 3D digital twin visualization
5. Instant quoting system
6. IP security (designs stay client-exclusive)

**Interest level:** HIGH
- Asked detailed questions about component library
- Explored custom component addition
- Discussed pricing/licensing models
- Scheduled follow-up (not a brush-off)

---

## Technical Requirements Identified

**Components they use:**
- Wago, Phoenix Contact, Siemens (procured via AWC)
- Custom component support needed

**Capabilities they need:**
- Enclosure sizing + face mounting
- Wire routing + labeling
- Schematic + layout views
- UL compliance checking (basic, in development)
- Export: wiring spreadsheets, terminal lists

**Security requirement:** Private design storage, IP protection

---

## Pricing & Access Model

**Their interest:** 
- Web-based licensing (per-user model)
- Flexible pricing for large teams (10+ users)
- Free 2-month trial as design partner
- On-premise hosting possible (but requires setup)

---

## Next Steps & Timeline

**What Tesla is doing:**
- Connect you with Drew (procurement team) for vendor onboarding
- Requires NDA before detailed discussions
- Follow-up meeting: **Last week of February (Feb 23-24)**

**What you need to do:**
- [ ] Sign NDA (request from Drew)
- [ ] Prepare competitive quote (apples-to-apples with current vendor)
- [ ] Refine UL compliance checking feature
- [ ] Demo scaled web app (multi-user setup)
- [ ] Prepare pricing for 10+ user teams

---

## Competitive Landscape

**Current vendor:** Registered/approved (details unknown)

**Your advantage:**
- Flexible component library (not locked to single vendor)
- Design-to-quote speed (custom app vs generic quotes)
- IP security (they value this)
- Smaller, more responsive than incumbent

**Risk:** Tesla values vendor stability. They'll compare:
- Price ✓ (you're flexible)
- Features ✓ (web app is differentiated)
- Support (you need to prove reliability)
- Compliance (UL checking is in development)

---

## Deal Potential

**Size:** Unknown (depends on Gigafactory panel volumes)

**Timeline:** 6+ weeks (NDA → quotes → evaluation → decision)

**Probability:** Medium-High (they invited you to quote against incumbent)

**Strategic value:** 
- OEM anchor customer (proof for other OEMs)
- Recurring licensing (web app users)
- Case study potential (even if not used, "Tesla evaluated" is huge)

---

## Critical Context

**NDA**: Will be required before detailed business discussions. Don't share specifics of their requirements publicly.

**Procurement process**: They have formal vendor onboarding. This could be 3-6 month sales cycle once you're registered.

**Reference check**: They may validate with Kentoro Robotics, wastewater facility, wire mesh company. Get those references prepped.

## Action Items for Caleb

1. [ ] Wait for Drew contact (procurement)
2. [ ] Prepare NDA response (legal review if needed)
3. [ ] Get references ready (Kentoro, Colorado wastewater, MA wire mesh)
4. [ ] Develop competitive quote template (for Feb 23-24 meeting)
5. [ ] Fast-track UL compliance checking feature
6. [ ] Test multi-user licensing (10+ user scenario)
7. [ ] Prepare on-premise hosting option (or decline clearly)
