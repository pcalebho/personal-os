# Market Intelligence - Reicher @ Rittal
**Date:** 2026-02-03  
**Source:** Sales lunch with Reicher (distributor/rep at Rittal)

## Sales Strategy Insights

**Best inbound path: Distributor relationships**
- Major distributors always have overflow work they farm out
- Build relationships with their outside salespeople
- They're constantly looking for trusted shops to handle surplus capacity
- This is more reliable than direct prospecting

## Geographic Market Analysis

**Austin Market:**
- Weak on industrial builds
- Lots of low-quality competition ("dumb competition")
- Demand is **lumpy** (unpredictable, bursty)

**Northeast vs Texas:**
- Northeast: Strong baseline manufacturing, consistent work
- Texas: Lumpy, feast/famine cycles
- When Northeast overflow happens, it's easier to find work in weaker markets

**Government/Public Work (Major Opportunity):**
- Austin has strong tech/public sector (water, government projects)
- Huge bids flowing through **EBC** (likely Engineer/Bid Centers or similar)
- Must be: Friendly with EBC contacts OR establish relationships with government procurement officers
- Riker will introduce to distributors

## Competitive Ecosystem

**Ex-Tesla People:** All converging on **Riddle + ePlan** as standard toolset
- This is the ecosystem/moat for modern panel shops
- Market is recognizing this stack (confirms your ePlan purchase priority)

## Margin & Business Model Reality

**Margins:** 10-40% (highly variable, depends on complexity & volume)

**Repeat business:** Weak overall
- Texas: Very weak repeat business
- Other areas: Also weak repeat business
- OEMs: Slightly stronger repeat, but still not reliable

**Market dynamics:** 
- Companies get huge influshes of work → overflow to subcontractors
- Then work dries up → they bring it back in-house
- This cyclicality creates the "lumpy" demand pattern

## Action Items (For Caleb)

1. **Follow up with Reicher's distributor intros** (priority)
2. **Research EBC for Austin public works bids**
3. **Build government procurement relationships**
4. **Master Riddle + ePlan** (market standard ecosystem)
5. **Price positioning:** Plan for 15-25% margins initially, with potential variance

## Key Takeaway

Distribution relationships → overflow work is more reliable than direct sales in lumpy markets. Government/public sector is the stronger play for Austin specifically.
