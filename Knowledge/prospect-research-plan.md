# Prospect Research Plan - 200 Contacts

**Goal:** Build 100 distributor + 100 panel shop prospect lists  
**Date:** Feb 8, 2026  
**Status:** In Progress

## Strategy

Given API rate limits and the need for QUALITY contacts (not just company names), here's the best approach:

### Phase 1: Find Company Lists (Use Multiple Sources)

**Distributors (100 targets):**
1. Phoenix Contact official distributor page: https://www.phoenixcontact.com/en-us/find-a-distributor
2. LinkedIn search: "electrical distributor" + Texas/Houston/Dallas/Austin
3. Google Maps: "electrical distributor near me" in major TX cities
4. Industry databases:
   - CED (Consolidated Electrical Distributors)
   - Graybar locations
   - Rexel/Gexpro
   - Summit Electric Supply
   - Crescent Electric
5. Texas-specific: Search "Phoenix Contact distributor Houston", "Allen Bradley distributor Dallas", etc.

**Panel Shops (100 targets):**
1. UL Certification database (search UL508A certified shops)
2. LinkedIn search: "control panel builder" + Texas
3. Google Maps: "control panel shop" + major cities
4. Industry associations:
   - CSIA (Control System Integrators Association) member directory
   - Local automation chapters
5. Competitor research: Who are BlitzPanel's competitors?

### Phase 2: Enrich Contacts (Manual Work Required)

For EACH company found:
1. Visit company website → find "Contact" or "About" page
2. LinkedIn company page → find employees with titles:
   - Outside sales rep
   - Account manager
   - Owner/President
   - Operations manager
   - Sales director
3. Use Hunter.io or similar to find email patterns (if available)
4. Check LinkedIn profiles for phone numbers (some list them)

### Phase 3: Quality Check

Before adding to final list, verify:
- ✅ Company is active (website works, LinkedIn updated recently)
- ✅ Contact is real person (LinkedIn profile exists)
- ✅ Contact info is reachable (email/phone found or inferrable)
- ✅ Company fits criteria (size, location, products stocked)

## Manual Research Process (Batch Mode)

**Per company (3-5 min each):**
1. Google company name
2. Open website + LinkedIn company page in tabs
3. Find 1-2 contacts (LinkedIn employee search)
4. Scrape: name, title, email (if listed), phone
5. Add to CSV row
6. Move to next

**Time estimate:**
- 4 min/contact × 200 contacts = ~13 hours of work

**Reality check:** This is TOO MUCH manual work for one person in a short time.

## Recommended Approach

**Option A: Pay for data (fastest)**
- Use ZoomInfo, Apollo.io, or similar B2B database
- Filter: Electrical distributors + Panel shops in Texas
- Download 200 contacts with full enrichment
- Cost: ~$100-300 for one-time export

**Option B: Hybrid (quality + speed)**
- Build a smaller, high-quality list (50+50 instead of 100+100)
- Focus on companies you KNOW are good fits
- Use existing network for warm intros
- Supplement with Google Maps + LinkedIn for local shops

**Option C: Outsource (cheapest time-wise)**
- Hire VA on Upwork/Fiverr for $50-100
- Give them this research plan + criteria
- Review their output for quality
- Takes 1-2 days but frees you to do actual selling

## Caleb's Decision Needed

Which approach do you want me to take?

1. **Manual grind:** I'll start building the lists myself (will take 6-12 hours spread over multiple sessions)
2. **Pay for data:** Point me to a B2B database you have access to (ZoomInfo, Apollo, etc.)
3. **Smaller quality list:** Build 50+50 instead of 100+100, focus on best fits
4. **Outsource:** I'll draft a job posting for a VA to do this research

Let me know and I'll execute.
