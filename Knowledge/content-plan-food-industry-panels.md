# Content: The Hidden Complexity of Food Industry Control Panels

**Format:** Narrative feature (Lenny's Newsletter style)  
**Target Length:** 700-900 words  
**Status:** Draft outline - ready for SME interview

## Narrative Hook

**"Why your $50k control panel might fail a food facility in 6 months"**

Most engineers designing control panels don't realize: food processing has insane requirements that don't show up in generic industrial specs. Temperature swings, washdown chemical exposure, FDA compliance, and constant sanitation = panels age 3x faster than traditional industrial environments.

---

## The Conflict / Tension Points

1. **The assumption gap:** Engineers spec a standard 304 stainless enclosure. Turns out food processors need stronger materials + sealed connectors for caustic sanitation chemicals.

2. **The hidden cost:** A panel that works fine in auto manufacturing fails catastrophically under daily caustic washdowns. Rework costs $20k+. Customer stops trusting you.

3. **The compliance surprise:** Food safety regs (FSMA, HACCP) require specific control logic and audit trails. Most panel shops don't bake this in initially.

## Story Structure

**Opening:** Real example of panel failure in a food facility (get SME to confirm/detail this)

**Why it matters:** Food industry = high stakes
- One contamination event = massive liability + recalls
- Margins are actually tight despite the criticality
- Engineers often design panels without understanding the *use case* environment

**The Nuances:**
- Material selection (316L stainless vs 304 vs powder coat + stainless)
- Seal/gasket requirements (washdown chemicals eat standard gaskets)
- Electrical component choices (moisture ingress is killer)
- Control logic for temperature/humidity alarms
- Documentation for FDA/food safety audits

**The Expert Take:** Interview a food processing facility manager OR a panel builder who specializes in this vertical

**The Lesson:** Vertical expertise > generic industrial knowledge. Panel shops that dominate food have obsessive attention to environment-specific details.

## CTA / Takeaway

"The best panel shops know their verticals obsessively. For food, that means understanding sanitation cycles, chemical exposure, and regulatory burden — not just electrical specs."

## SME/Interviewee Candidates (Brainstorm)

- Food processing facility operations director
- Panel builder who specializes in food industry (HVAC, refrigeration, packaging systems)
- Food safety consultant
- Rittal/Schneider rep who sells food industry solutions

## Why This Works

✅ Solves a real problem (panel failures in harsh environments)  
✅ Has narrative tension (spec wrong → expensive failure)  
✅ Positions Blitzpanel as specialist-minded  
✅ Drives inbound: food facilities searching "control panels for food industry"
