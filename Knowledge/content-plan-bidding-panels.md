## Narrative Hook

**"We lost a $40k panel bid to a shop quoting $22k. Here's what we learned."**

Panel bidding is brutal. Most shops compete on price. A few shops compete on understanding the customer's *actual problem*. The latter wins, keeps margin, and builds repeat business.

## The Conflict / Tension Points

1. **The commoditization trap:** Customer sends RFQ with basic specs. 5 shops quote. Lowest bidder wins. Everyone assumes panel = fungible commodity.

2. **The spec ambiguity problem:** Most RFQs are incomplete. Winning shops probe the ambiguity, add value through engineering, and quote higher (and win). Losing shops just quote the spec.

3. **The margin compression cycle:** Price-based bidding only attracts price-based competition. You're stuck in a race to the bottom.

4. **The buyer's reality:** Facility manager cares about: Will it work? Will it install on time? Will you support us? Price is secondary. But if you respond to an RFQ without addressing these, you're already lost.

## Story Structure

**Opening:** Real example of losing a bid, then getting follow-up call: "Your competitor's panel failed. Can you retrofit it?"

**Why it matters:**
- Most panel shops treat bidding as pure cost competition
- This destroys margins industry-wide
- Shops that win on *understanding the problem* maintain 25-35% margins

**The Nuances:**
- How to read between the lines of an RFQ
- Questions to ask that reveal the real requirements
- How to position your bid around *customer success* not just component cost
- When to walk away from a bid (not worth margin)
- Building long-term customer relationships vs one-off transactional bids

**The Expert Take:** Interview a facility manager (buyer) + a panel shop owner with strong margins

**The Lesson:** Winning bids aren't about lowest price. They're about deepest understanding of customer's problem.
