# Fouad - Mariana Minerals (Feb 6, 2026)

**Date:** Feb 6, 2026  
**Contact:** Fouad  
**Role:** Controls engineer (software-focused, digital twins/ML)  
**Company:** Mariana Minerals (mining, Series A funded)  
**Location:** HQ Bay Area, contingent Houston; operations Utah (copper mine)  
**Outcome:** Strategic insights on RFP pain + in-house vs outsource decision

---

## Company Context

**Business:** Autonomous mining operations (copper mine in Utah)
- Digital twins + ML to optimize mining processes
- Recently Series A funded
- Consolidating scattered chemical dosing processes → standardized control
- Adding more IO instruments/panels for higher-fidelity data

**Current strategy:**
- Pilot/R&D versions: Build in-house (changes within days/weeks)
- Commercial scale: Outsource decision pending (in-house vs vendor)

---

## Pain Points (RFP Process)

### Vendor Selection Bottleneck
**Current approach:** Outsource to international vendors (India, South America, South Africa)

**Why it sucks:**
1. **Extensive RFP back-and-forth**
   - Design drawings required upfront
   - Control narratives, P&IDs needed
   - Multiple rounds of clarification

2. **Vendor information needs**
   - Require detailed site specs (power, layout, environmental factors)
   - Factory Acceptance Testing (FAT) complexity
   - Warranty issues when mods needed post-delivery

3. **Speed vs compliance tradeoff**
   - Currently bypass UL rating for speed
   - Accept changes during commissioning (not ideal)
   - Want commercial solution but faster process

### Internal Workarounds
- Built custom workflow automation tools
- Saved 35-40% time on documentation output
- Working in parallel vs sequential (accelerate decisions)

---

## Technical Requirements

### Design-Build Scope
- Full design, procurement, assembly
- DIN rail mounting, terminal blocks, etc.
- **NO programming services needed** (they handle controls)
- Need partnership capability (work with fab shops for capacity/expertise)

### Factory Acceptance Testing
- Customer requires FAT procedures (longer timeline, acceptable)
- Standard: PLC programming verification, IO checkout, redundancy testing
- Site-wide UPS + panel-based UPS backup systems

---

## Market Insights

### Series A Software Company Behavior
- Fast decision-making (parallel workflows)
- Willing to bypass compliance temporarily if deadline critical
- High tolerance for iteration (build, test, modify)
- Value speed + flexibility > lowest cost

### Vendor Selection Criteria
- **Primary:** Can you deliver without 6-month RFP cycle?
- **Secondary:** Full design-build capability (not just assembly)
- **Tertiary:** FAT support + warranty (clear contract terms)

### Opportunity Areas
1. **Small OEMs with repetitive builds** (breweries, food processing)
   - Similar pain point: RFP cycles, design expertise gap
   - Potential for SPA-like repeating orders
   
2. **On-site support services** for larger customers
   - FAT support, commissioning, modifications
   - Could command premium for hands-on service

---

## Strategic Implications

**What Fouad needs:**
1. Shorter RFP cycle (not 3+ months of drawings)
2. Parallel execution (design + procurement happening simultaneously)
3. Documentation automation (he's built this internally—you could offer it)
4. FAT-ready panels (built for testing, not just delivery)

**Where Blitzpanel fits:**
- RFP automation (extract requirements → generate P&ID + panel design)
- Documentation output (parallel workflows, fast turnaround)
- Full design-build (end-to-end, not just assembly)
- FAT support (trained technicians on-site for acceptance testing)

**NOT a fit:**
- International shipping/sourcing (he already does this)
- UL compliance workarounds (he accepts bypassing, we shouldn't enable)
- PLC programming (he has in-house expertise)

---

## Next Steps

- [ ] Clarify: Is Fouad evaluating US vendors for commercial scale? (opportunity to pitch)
- [ ] Understand: What's the timeline for commercial procurement decision?
- [ ] Explore: Would RFP automation + parallel workflows solve his pain?
- [ ] Research: Brewery OEM market (his suggestion for repetitive builds)

## Pattern Tracking

**Hypothesis:** Engineering-as-a-service (spec automation) is bigger than build speed

**Evidence (7 conversations):**
1. Warehouse/Santiago: Design elimination + 3D viz
2. Control Associates grandfather: Engineering time bottleneck
3. Richard Garza (ATI): Cross-team coordination
4. Dylan Rose (American Terawatt): Component substitution + compliance
5. **Fouad (Mariana): RFP cycle pain + documentation automation**

**Emerging pattern:** 
- Speed of *response* matters (parallel workflows, not manufacturing speed)
- Design automation matters (P&IDs, documentation, specification clarity)
- Management of complexity matters (FAT, compliance, technical handoffs)
- Nobody cares about build speed; everyone cares about design clarity

## Deal Potential

**Likelihood:** Low-medium (Series A software, not traditional OEM/integrator)
**Timeline:** 6+ months (commercial scale decision pending)
**Deal value:** Unknown (depends on panel volume at scale)

**But:** High-value strategic insights for product roadmap.
