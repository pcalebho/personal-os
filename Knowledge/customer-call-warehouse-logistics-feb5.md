## Key Insights

### Current Panel Design Process Issues
- **No internal panel design expertise** in company
- Current workflow: Photos → cheapest bidder for drawings → contract to panel shop
- **Frequent redlines** due to poor drawing quality
- External wireman struggled (not skill issue, confusing inputs)
- **Volume:** 12-20 panels/year (mix of unique + modular variations)

### Specific Project Examples
- **Recent conveyor project:** 3 panels, 5x3 feet, 6 VFDs each
- **Turnaround:** 2.5-3 weeks from order to delivery
- Panel shop had to visit warehouse to understand requirements (communication breakdown)
- **Safety scanner setups:** Often over-engineered (3-4 inputs, only use 1)

### Blitzpanel Demo Response
✅ **Impressed with 3D visualization + auto manufacturing instructions**  
✅ **Interested in prepared enclosure option** (cutouts, trunking, din rail only)  
✅ **Sees value** in eliminating drawing errors + communication barriers  
✅ **Wants to bypass inefficient internal process entirely**

### Potential Use Cases
1. Replace entire current panel design workflow
2. Pre-build panels with cable trunking → send to shop for wiring only
3. Reduce panel shop's stocking requirements + design time
4. Pitch directly to management with completed quotes/designs
5. Explore opportunities with current panel contractor

## Value Props That Resonated
- **Elimination of drawing errors** (biggest pain point)
- **3D visualization** (clear communication)

## Next Steps
1. Send formal quote for typical panel (conveyor example)
2. Prepare pitch deck for management
3. Offer to visit warehouse + current panel shop
4. Position as: "Your internal panel design team"

## Deal Potential
- 12-20 panels/year
- Mix of 5x3 ft panels with VFDs
- Estimated value: $10-15k/panel = **$120-300k annual**
- High probability if we can prove design quality + speed
