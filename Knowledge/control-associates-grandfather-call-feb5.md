# Control Associates Inc - Grandfather Call (Feb 5, 2026)

**Date:** Feb 5, 2026  
**Contact:** Mason's Grandfather (owner)  
**Company:** Control Associates Inc (since 1987)  
**Type:** Controls house (design, field service, build)  
**Volume:** 4-6 enclosures/month (range: 2-12)

---

## 🔥 THE BIG INSIGHT

**The real problem isn't build speed - it's ENGINEERING TIME.**

---

## Business Model

**Industries served:**
- Power
- Food processing
- Wastewater
- Water treatment

**What they sell:**
- Complete control system designs (not just panels)
- Engineering + integration + field service

**Build split:**
- **In-house:** Small panels
- **Outsource:** Cabinet-size assemblies
- **Approach:** Stock enclosures + modifications (not custom fab)

---

## The Real Bottleneck: Engineering Time

### Current Pain Points

1. **Can't afford detailed specs**
   - Provides rough sketches instead of full JIC drawings
   - Time constraint forces incomplete specs
   - Leads to back-and-forth with shops

2. **Iterative customer changes**
   - Customers change requirements after initial design
   - Shops need to re-quote
   - "We hope not, but it does happen" - normal but painful

3. **Enclosure sizing conflicts**
   - Customers request smaller boxes after seeing design
   - Field serviceability vs space optimization tension
   - Requires redesign work

### What He Values in Shops

✅ **Collaboration over price**
- Shops that provide design feedback + suggestions
- "Bottom dollar doesn't usually scare us away"
- Values partnership, not just execution

✅ **Engineering support**
- Shops that can fill specification gaps
- Suggestions on: door hinges, mounting, routing, improvements
- Ability to handle mid-project changes

✅ **Specialized capabilities**
- Pneumatic tubing/piping (copper, stainless)
- Not just electrical - mechanical integration too

❌ **NOT pure speed**
- Would NOT choose $1000 cheaper if it's a week slower
- Speed matters, but not at expense of quality/collaboration

## Strategic Implications

### What This Means for Blitzpanel

**Wrong value prop:**
- ❌ "We're faster than other shops"
- ❌ "We're cheaper"

**Right value prop:**
- ✅ **"We're your engineering extension"**
- ✅ **"Give us rough sketches, we'll handle the rest"**
- ✅ **"We fill design gaps so you don't have to"**

### Product Pivot Needed?

**Current positioning:** Fast automated panel builds  
**Market need:** Engineering-as-a-service + collaborative design

**Gap to bridge:**
- Can your app turn rough sketches into detailed specs?
- Can you handle iterative changes without painful re-quotes?
- Do you have pneumatic/mechanical capabilities?

---

## Competitive Insight

**Why current shops fail him:**
- They require detailed specs (he doesn't have time)
- They don't suggest improvements (just execute)
- Changes = slow + expensive re-quotes

**His ideal shop:**
- Takes rough input
- Engineers the details
- Suggests optimizations
- Handles changes gracefully
- Builds it right

---

## Next Steps

- [ ] Demo scheduled (coordinate via Mason's email)
- [ ] Research pneumatic panel capabilities
- [ ] Prepare demo focused on: "Design from rough specs"
- [ ] Test messaging: "Engineering-as-a-service" vs "Fast builds"

## Validation Questions for Next 10 Calls

**Test this hypothesis:**
"Integrators/controls houses are bottlenecked on engineering time, not build time."

**Ask:**
1. "Do you provide detailed specs to your shop, or rough sketches?"
2. "What happens when customers change requirements mid-project?"
3. "Would you value a shop that engineers panels from rough input?"
4. "What's more valuable: 50% faster build, or 50% less engineering time for you?"

**If this pattern repeats → PIVOT:**
- Position as: "Panel design-as-a-service" not "Fast builds"
- Feature: Upload rough sketch → we engineer full spec
- Value prop: Save YOUR engineering time, not ours

---

## Deal Potential

- 4-6 panels/month = 48-72/year
- Mix of small (in-house capable) + large (outsourced)
- Not price-sensitive
- Values collaboration
- **Likelihood:** Medium-High if demo shows engineering value

**Estimated value:** $50-100k/year (depends on panel complexity)
