# Dylan Rose - American Terawatt (Feb 6, 2026)

**Date:** Feb 6, 2026  
**Contact:** Dylan Rose  
**Company:** American Terawatt (power generation targeting data centers)  
**Background:** 3 years data center ops, consumer electronics  
**Outcome:** Warm lead, early stage, will reconnect when ready for panel design

## Company Strategy

**Vision:** Become power company by entering data center builds

**Why data centers?**
- Only viable entry point for new energy companies
- Capital + banking concentrated in data center space
- Largest available TAM for new power entrants

**Business model:** End-to-end data center development
- Site selection → fully built shell → customer handoff
- Currently standardizing bill of materials + component designs

---

## Panel Architecture (Multi-Level)

### Pod Level (~12 racks)
- Dedicated control panel per pod
- Focus: industrial automation controls + sensor data aggregation

### Building Level
- Monitoring panel for ~5 halls
- Aggregates pod-level data

### Site Level
- Monitoring across multiple buildings
- Overall system health

### Specific Panels Needed
- Generator panels
- Battery backup panels
- UL 508A spec (<600V)

**NOT switchboards/switchgear** — pure controls + instrumentation

---

## Current Challenges

### 1. Physical Layout Complexity
- Bill of materials complete, but physical layout creates component dependencies
- Layout changes cascade into BOM changes

### 2. Component Substitution
- Need **generative system** for substitutions when parts unavailable
- Can't be locked into single-source components

### 3. Compliance Requirements
- Fighting through regulatory complexity
- UL, electrical code compliance layered on top of design

### 4. Stage of Development
- Still 10,000ft view (early architecture phase)
- Not ready for detailed panel specifications yet
- Will be ready in future (TBD timeline)

---

## Vendor Ecosystem

**Current partners:**
- Schweitzer (controls)
- Schneider, MGM (transformers, power, switchgear)
- Vertiv

**Approach:**
- Using Schneider reference designs as foundation
- Need flexibility to swap vendors based on availability/cost

## Strategic Implications for Blitzpanel

**What American Terawatt needs:**
1. **Configurable panel design** (not one-size-fits-all)
2. **Component substitution automation** (when parts unavailable)
3. **Compliance-aware design** (UL, electrical code baked in)
4. **Integration with vendor ecosystem** (Schneider, Schweitzer, Vertiv)

**Deal potential:** 
- High-value (data center power = big budget)
- Long sales cycle (early stage now)
- Future opportunity (not immediate)

**Likelihood to buy:** Medium-high (when ready, likely to need automated design)

## Next Steps

- [ ] Dylan will reconnect when American Terawatt is ready for detailed panel specs
- [ ] Timeline unknown (early stage)
- [ ] Keep relationship warm (quarterly check-ins?)
- [ ] Watch for architectural complexity signals (good fit for Blitzpanel automation)

## Pattern Tracking

**Hypothesis:** Engineering-as-a-service (spec automation) is bigger than build speed

**Evidence (6 conversations):**
1. Warehouse/logistics: wants design elimination
2. Control Associates grandfather: engineering time is bottleneck
3. Richard Garza: cross-team coordination + lead time visibility
4. **Dylan Rose: component substitution + compliance automation (generative system)**

**Trend strengthening:** Nobody mentions "build faster." Everyone mentions "spec complexity" or "design automation."
