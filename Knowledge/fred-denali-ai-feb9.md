# Fred - Denali AI (Feb 9, 2026)

**Date:** Feb 9, 2026  
**Contact:** Fred  
**Company:** Denali AI (warehouse/logistics, 3 years old)  
**Customer:** "Probably the biggest company on Earth" (confidential)  
**Outcome:** 🔥 HOT OEM customer, paid pilot likely, follow-up Monday

## Company Context

**Business:** Imaging-based decision-making systems
- Barcode scan tunnels
- Computer vision
- Modular materials handling applications

**Major customer:** Massive enterprise (details confidential)

---

## The Critical Problem

**Current situation:**
- Heavily reliant on ONE 2-person contractor shop (friend of boss)
- Contractor is becoming bottleneck as volume explodes
- ISO 9000 certification will flag single-source dependency
- Fred wants in-house design capability

**Volume explosion (2025):**
- 1,100 panels (single design)
- 75 panels (European project, different design)
- 400-500 panels (third project, third design)
- **Total: 1,500+ panels, 3-4 concurrent designs**

**Iteration speed:** 2-3 months POC → pilot → production

**Recent example:** 7-site deployment (Oct) now needs complete redesign
- Quote needed by end of week
- Production 2-3 weeks after PO

## Why Blitzpanel Resonates

**Fred's strategic need:**
1. Multi-source (reduce dependency on 2-person shop)
2. Speed (fast design + iteration)
3. In-house capability building (learning, not just outsourcing)
4. Scale (handle 1,000+ unit runs)

**Your web app delivers:**
- Rapid design iteration (schematic → 3D → quote in minutes)
- Compliance built-in (UL508A)
- Collaboration tools (teams + comments)
- Cost-effective ($600/yr vs Eplan $1,500)

---

## Demo Feedback

**What Fred saw:**
- Web-based 3D CAD tool + component libraries
- Workflow: schematic → 2D layout → 3D visualization → instant quote
- Interference checking
- Export: schematic, BOM, wire diagrams
- Collaboration + commenting

**Limitations he acknowledged:**
- No 3D export (feasible, not urgent)
- Rules engine still developing (electrical best practices)
- No thermal analysis / auto fan recommendations (nice-to-have)
- Library still growing (can customize)

**His reaction:** Not dismissive. Interested in pilot.

## Deal Structure

**Pricing discussion:**
- Your ask: $600/year per user
- His comparison: Eplan $1,500/year
- His ask: Paid pilot with 50% refund if unsatisfactory

**Next steps:**
- NDA process (Fred will connect with alliances lead)
- Fred sends existing panel design after NDA
- Follow-up call: **Monday, same time next week**
- Paid pilot on next new project (timeline: TBD)

---

## Sales Opportunity

**Deal size:** Unknown, but signals:
- 1,500+ panels/year = significant volume
- 3-4 concurrent designs = ongoing licensing
- Likely 3-5 internal users (minimum $1,800-3,000/year)
- Expansion potential (in-house design practice)

**Sales cycle:** 
- Pilot: 1-2 weeks
- Decision: If successful, likely to expand after pilot

**Strategic value:**
- OEM validation (like Tesla)
- Proof of "rapid iteration" capability
- Wastewater case study type customer (repeatable pattern)

---

## Competitive Threat

**Their current vendor:** 2-person contractor shop
- Probably charging 2-3x what you'll quote
- Capacity-constrained
- Not scalable

**Your advantage:**
- Speed (web-based, instant updates)
- Compliance (UL508A built-in)
- Cost (significantly lower)
- Scalability (infinite concurrent users)

**Your risk:**
- Fred might just optimize existing relationship (negotiate better rates)
- Internal friction (contractor is "friend of boss")

## Action Items

1. [ ] Wait for alliances lead contact (NDA process)
2. [ ] Prepare for NDA signing
3. [ ] When Fred sends panel design, do rapid turnaround review
4. [ ] Prepare pricing for 3-5 user team (volume discount?)
5. [ ] Refine web app for "batch" operations (1,000+ unit designs)
6. [ ] Have rules engine + best practices ready by next Monday
7. [ ] Prepare follow-up for Monday call (be ready for objections on features)

## Timeline

- **This week:** Wait for NDA
- **Next week (Feb 17):** Follow-up call, send design review, discuss pilot timing
- **Week of Feb 24+:** Pilot project (if approved)
