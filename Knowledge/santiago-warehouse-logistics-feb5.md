# Santiago - Warehouse/Logistics Company (Feb 5, 2026)

**Date:** Feb 5, 2026  
**Contact:** Santiago  
**Company:** Warehouse/Logistics (name TBD - get contact info + company name)  
**Volume:** 12-20 panels/year (recent: 3 panels, 5x3 feet, 6 VFDs each)  
**Turnaround:** 2.5-3 weeks from order to delivery  
**Outcome:** 🔥 HOT LEAD - Impressed, wants to replace entire design workflow

---

## Current Process (Broken)

**No in-house panel design expertise:**
- Take photos → send to cheapest bidder for drawings → contract to panel shop
- Result: frequent redlines from panel shop (poor drawing quality)
- External wireman struggled with confusing inputs (not skill issue—bad specs)

**Why it fails:**
- Panel shop has to visit warehouse to understand requirements (waste of time)
- Over-engineered designs (safety scanners using 1 of 4 inputs)
- Communication barriers between teams
- Cheap upfront cost, expensive in rework/delays

## Blitzpanel Demo Response

**What impressed Santiago:**
- ✅ 3D visualization (see what you're building before manufacturing)
- ✅ Automatic manufacturing instructions (eliminates drawing redlines)
- ✅ Prepared enclosure option (pre-cut, trunking, DIN rail, ready for wiring)

**What he wants:**
1. Eliminate current inefficient internal process entirely
2. Pre-built panels with cable trunking
3. Send to shop for wiring/assembly only (no design needed)
4. Reduce panel shop's design time + stocking requirements
5. Pitch directly to management with completed quotes + designs

## Opportunity

**Use case:** Complete replacement of current workflow

**Value:**
- Santiago gets: No design expertise needed, faster turnaround, fewer redlines
- Panel shop gets: Pre-engineered design, less rework, faster assembly
- Blitzpanel gets: 12-20 panels/year, potential SPA-like repeating orders

**Deal value:** $120-300k/year (estimated)

**Next steps:**
- [ ] Get Santiago's contact name + company name
- [ ] Get management contact info (they approve budget)
- [ ] Prepare quote for recent conveyor project (3 panels, 5x3, 6 VFDs)
- [ ] Send 3D design mockup + manufacturing instructions
- [ ] Schedule presentation to management

## Product Validation

**This conversation confirms:**
- 3D visualization is HIGH VALUE (not just nice-to-have)
- Prepared enclosures (pre-cut, trunking) = major differentiator
- Spec automation (eliminate design step) = real pain point
- Management approval needed (sales motion = tech person + budget holder)

## Contact Info Needed

- Santiago's last name + title
- Company name + location
- Management contact (budget approval)
- Email + phone
- Best time to present to leadership team
