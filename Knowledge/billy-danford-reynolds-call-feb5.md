## Key Learnings

### SPA (Special Pricing Agreement)
- **Timeline:** ~2 months to finalize SPA
- **Leverage:** Higher volume = better pricing
- **Process:** Request quote → Billy returns pricing within ~1 hour
- Won't match Automation Direct pricing, but offers other value

### Value Proposition (Why Reynolds vs Automation Direct)
- **ABB prioritization** - Deep product knowledge
- **Specialist support** - Technical expertise to sell/spec correctly
- **Service over price** - Make money on value-add, not just product margin

### Portal Access
- Reynolds has a customer portal
- Pricing won't be available until SPA is finalized
- Portal is **not unified** - won't have all your pricing consolidated

### Business Development Opportunity
**Texas Water Show** - Major trade show for getting business
- Large opportunity for panel shops
- **Critical:** Need to stand out somehow (not just show up)
- Action: Research how to differentiate at trade show

## Strategic Implications

**Distributor partnership value:**
1. Technical support (specialists who know ABB/Allen Bradley deeply)
2. Fast quoting (1 hour turnaround)
3. Local relationship in Austin market
4. Access to major projects (Billy quotes most major capital projects)

**Trade-offs:**
- Higher pricing than Automation Direct (commodity distributor)
- 2-month wait for SPA
- Portal won't have unified pricing

**Positioning:**
- Reynolds = premium distributor for technical projects
- Automation Direct = commodity pricing for standard parts
- Use both strategically based on project complexity
