# Content: Starting a Control Panel Shop - The Unsexy Reality

## Narrative Hook

**"Everyone wants to start a panel shop. Nobody mentions the 18-month cash burn."**

Panel manufacturing seems like a good business: recurring demand, decent margins, relatively simple tooling. But the reality is brutal. Most shops fold in year 2 because founders underestimate operational complexity + cash flow pressure.

## The Conflict / Tension Points

1. **The working capital trap:** You need to buy materials 60 days before you get paid by customers. Most founders run out of cash before they get to profitability.

2. **The expertise gap:** Building panels is easy. Running a panel *business* requires sales, scheduling, quality control, and hiring — none of which engineers understand.

3. **The customer concentration trap:** Your first 3 customers might be 80% of revenue. One leaves = existential crisis. But you're too small to have pipeline/sales process.

4. **The equipment capex problem:** You need CNC machines, test equipment, tooling. But you can't justify it until you have revenue. This is the bootstrap paradox.

## Story Structure

**Opening:** Interview founder who started panel shop, hit month 18, ran out of capital, had to shut down (or sell cheap)

**Why it matters:**
- Panel shops *look* like easy business
- But operational/financial reality is harsh
- Most founders fail because they solve engineering, not business problems

**The Nuances:**
- Minimum capex to get started (does it align with revenue growth)
- Customer acquisition costs (often higher than founders expect)
- Working capital management (the real killer)
- When to hire first salesperson vs engineer
- Finding co-founders or mentors who've done this
- Deal structure: should you bootstrap, take investment, or start inside existing company?

**The Expert Take:** Interview a panel shop founder who made it past year 3 (or who failed and learned from it)

**The Lesson:** Most panel shop failures aren't due to product. They're due to cash flow + sales.

## CTA / Takeaway

"Starting a panel shop requires more business acumen than technical skill. Get this wrong, and you'll run out of capital before you find product-market fit."
