# Industrial Space Leasing - Key Learnings

## Credit Requirements

**Most leasers will NOT offer good lease terms without business credit.**

This is a common blocker for early-stage businesses.

## Options When You Don't Have Business Credit

### Option 1: Personal Credit
- Use your personal credit instead of business credit
- **Downside:** Not ideal for separating personal and business finances
- **When to use:** If you have strong personal credit and short-term space need

### Option 2: Bank Statements
- Many leasers ask for last 2 years of banking statements to verify cash flow
- **Downside:** We don't have 2 years of statements yet (early stage)
- **Workaround:** Can show recent statements if leasers will accept < 2 years

### Option 3: Larger Security Deposit (BEST WORKAROUND)
- Offer a larger upfront security deposit to offset credit risk
- **Upside:** Very effective workaround; demonstrates commitment
- **Cost:** More capital upfront, but recoverable at lease end
- **Best for:** Early-stage businesses with some cash available

## Recommendation

For Blitzpanel's current situation (early stage, building credit):
- **Negotiate larger security deposit** in exchange for flexible lease terms
- Position it as: "We're committed long-term and willing to show it with a larger deposit"
- Aim to negotiate: 3-4 months rent deposit instead of standard 1-2 months
