# Austin - Advanced Nuclear Reactor Startup (Feb 10, 2026)

**Date:** Feb 10, 2026  
**Contact:** Austin  
**Company:** Advanced nuclear reactor startup (VC-backed)  
**HQ:** Austin, TX; Engineering: Idaho Falls  
**Stage:** First demonstration reactor at Idaho National Lab (DOE facility)  
**Outcome:** Strategic fit for future, currently too early stage

## Company Context

**Business:** Advanced nuclear reactor design & manufacturing

**Manufacturing philosophy:** Pull everything in-house possible
- Already have: water jet, vessel roller, welding, CNC mill/lathe
- Planning: pump manufacturing (eventual)
- Starting with: I&C (instrumentation & control) panels

**Current I&C panel approach:**
- All in-house except box fabrication
- Idaho team handles: spec, procurement, hardware selection
- Goal: UL 508A certification
- Timeline: 6 weeks (4 weeks engineering, 2 weeks fabrication)
- Recent test rig: 3ft x 3ft, single PLC, basic I/O
- CAD tool: SolidWorks Electrical (fought hard to get, vs company standard NX)

## The Real Problem: Engineering Time in Dynamic Environment

### Timeline Breakdown
- **Total:** 6 weeks
- **Engineering:** 4 weeks (2/3 of effort)
- **Fabrication:** 2 weeks (1/3 of effort)

**Key insight:** Like Control Associates grandfather, engineering time is the bottleneck.

### Dynamic Requirements (The Killer)
Requirements change frequently, right up until build:
- **Example 1:** Switching from 4-20mA to 10V DC processors mid-design
- **Example 2:** Changing from 120V AC to 24V DC power mid-design
- **Need:** Ability to accommodate changes up until fabrication starts

### Compliance Complexity
- **Standard:** UL 508A (all projects)
- **Additional:** Nuclear-specific compliance
  - IEEE codes
  - Specific nuclear regulatory codes (Austin to research + share)
  - Beyond standard industrial controls

### Panel Features
- Includes pneumatics (various form factors)
- Multiple I/O configurations
- Dynamic spec requirements

## Why Blitzpanel Resonates (But Not Today)

### What Austin Wants
"Would buy mature solution **today** if available"

**Ideal workflow:**
1. Spreadsheet inputs (requirements)
2. Automated panel population (AI spec generation)
3. Work instructions (manufacturing docs)
4. Compliance verification (UL + nuclear checks)
5. Export to SolidWorks Electrical or compatible CAD

**Acceptance criteria:**
- Low friction integration into existing SolidWorks Electrical workflow
- Immediate ROI on day one
- 80% automation acceptable (engineer makes final tweaks)
- Mature product (no proof-of-concepts or alpha testing)
- Premium pricing acceptable for right solution

### Why Blitzpanel Today Is Too Early
- Pre-seed, human-in-loop manufacturing service (not software)
- Not integrated with SolidWorks Electrical
- Not mature enough for nuclear compliance automation
- Requires live engineering support (doesn't scale for their needs)

### Reference Point
Austin cited **Silkline** (purchase order automation) as example of successful AI tool adoption in their world. That's the maturity level they're looking for.

## Strategic Value (Future)

**Deal potential:** MASSIVE (if/when you build the product)
- Advanced nuclear = high-value, high-compliance industry
- Willing to pay premium for right solution
- Already bought into automation (Silkline reference)
- Strong relationship potential (Austin to share nuclear codes, help with roadmap)

**Timeline:** 12-24 months minimum (product maturity needed)

**How to stay connected:**
- Get the nuclear compliance codes Austin researches
- Update Austin quarterly on product progress
- When SolidWorks Electrical integration is ready, circle back
- Potential for case study when they're live

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **Engineering time dominates (pattern confirmed)** — 4 weeks out of 6-week project
2. **Dynamic requirements are real pain** — changes up to build time, expensive rework
3. **Compliance is complex** — nuclear adds layer beyond UL 508A
4. **Premium product acceptance** — they'll pay for mature, integrated solution
5. **Market exists** — VC-backed advanced reactor companies (multiple companies in this space)

## Next Steps

- [ ] Get nuclear compliance codes from Austin (when researched)
- [ ] Document as reference material for future product roadmap
- [ ] Keep in nurture cycle (quarterly updates on progress)
- [ ] When SolidWorks Electrical integration exists, reach back out
- [ ] Explore other advanced reactor startups (Oklo, Commonwealth, X-energy, etc.) as TAM

## Competitive Threat / Opportunity

**Threat:** If someone else builds this (mature, SolidWorks-integrated, nuclear-compliant), Austin will buy immediately.

**Opportunity:** If you build it right, advanced nuclear is a multi-million-dollar TAM that's currently underserved (nobody's built the Silkline equivalent for control panels yet).
