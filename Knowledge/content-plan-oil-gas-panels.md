## Narrative Hook

**"Oil & Gas wanted our panel. We said yes. We shouldn't have."**

Oil & Gas is lucrative, but it's where panel shops get trapped into low-margin commodity work. Long lead times, brutal specs, certification nightmares, and customer leverage flatten your margins to 5-10%.

## The Conflict / Tension Points

1. **The margin trap:** O&G projects *look* big (high dollar value). But they demand custom specs, long R&D cycles, and customer has all the negotiating power. Margin gets compressed to 8-12%.

2. **The certification gauntlet:** Every O&G customer has different cert requirements. API, ASME, ISO, company-specific standards. Sourcing + testing = months of lead time before you even build.

3. **The customer leverage problem:** O&G suppliers are huge. They expect favorable payment terms, design flexibility, and 24/7 support. Small shops can't afford this operationally.

4. **The geographic trap:** Some O&G work is concentrated in specific regions. You chase it, build expertise, then the market shifts and your specialty becomes a liability.

## Story Structure

**Opening:** Real example of panel shop that took an O&G contract, got stuck in cert rabbit hole, and realized margin was 6% by completion

**Why it matters:**
- O&G is perceived as "easy money" but it's actually the opposite
- Many shop owners chase it without understanding the operational cost
- Vertical specialization in O&G requires *massive* capex (certs, equipment, expertise)

**The Nuances:**
- API/ASME compliance requirements
- Downhole vs topside panel differences
- Certification timelines (often 6+ months)
- Customer design change cycles and impact on timeline
- When to say "no" to O&G work as a small shop

**The Expert Take:** Interview a small-to-mid panel shop owner who works O&G (or explicitly decided NOT to)

**The Lesson:** Not all revenue is equal. Sometimes O&G work doesn't fit your model.

## CTA / Takeaway

"O&G is attractive but operationally expensive. Know your margins before you say yes to the certification burden."
