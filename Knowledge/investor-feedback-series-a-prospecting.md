# Investor Feedback: Series A Self-Serve Customer Acquisition

**Date:** 2026-02-03  
**Source:** Investor suggestion on GTM strategy  
**Topic:** Panel customer acquisition hypothesis

---

## The Hypothesis

Focus on **Series A companies** as initial self-serve customers instead of chasing large OEMs or distributors.

**Why Series A is the sweet spot:**
- Young enough to be flexible on sourcing/vendors
- Mature enough to have operational budgets + panel needs
- Less entrenched in legacy supplier relationships
- Often building new products/lines = fresh panel demand
- Earlier stage = faster decision-making than Fortune 500

---

## Proposed Approach

**Step 1: Source + Qualify**
- Use BuildList to find Series A companies
- Filter for companies likely to need control panels:
  - Manufacturing/hardware companies
  - Industrial automation / robotics
  - Food/beverage processing (if applicable)
  - Energy / utilities tech
  - Supply chain / logistics automation

**Step 2: AI-Powered Targeting**
- For each company, use AI to determine: Who owns panel/manufacturing procurement?
  - Website scraping (company structure pages)
  - LinkedIn analysis (job titles, departments)
  - Guess based on company profile (VP Ops? Engineering Lead? Founder?)
- Output: Company + likely contact person + title

**Step 3: Personalized Outreach**
- Draft email explaining Blitzpanel offering
- Personalize to their company/industry if possible
- Include: "If [person name] isn't the right contact, can you intro me to [job title]?"
- Offer to discuss onboarding / capabilities

**Step 4: Test Before Scale**
- Send to 5-10 companies first
- Track response rate / meetings booked
- Iterate email based on feedback
- Then scale to larger batch if working

## Potential Advantages

✅ **Higher response rate:** Personalized + warm intro request beats cold email  
✅ **Faster sales cycle:** Series A = faster decisions than enterprise  
✅ **Lower CAC:** Email outreach cheaper than trade shows / enterprise sales  
✅ **Better fit:** These companies actually *need* custom panels  
✅ **Reference customers:** Early wins = case studies for larger customers later

## Questions / Unknowns

- How many Series A companies on BuildList fit panel-need profile?
- What's realistic conversion rate on cold personalized email?
- Should we start with specific verticals (food? robotics? automation?) or shotgun approach?
- What's the ideal email hook? (Speed? Custom design? Local Austin shop?)

## Next Steps (If Pursuing)

1. [ ] Scope BuildList data + filter for likely customers
2. [ ] Build AI pipeline to identify procurement contacts
3. [ ] Draft test email (3 versions to A/B)
4. [ ] Send to 5-10 test targets
5. [ ] Track responses + iterate
6. [ ] Scale based on results

## Alignment with Current Goals

- **Sales System (P0):** This is direct 1 panel/week prospecting
- **Product** (positioning): Proves market demand + use cases
- **Hiring:** Early customers = proof points for SWE hires
