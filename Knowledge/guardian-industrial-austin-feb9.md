# Guardian Industrial - Austin (Feb 9, 2026)

**Date:** Feb 9, 2026  
**Contact:** Guardian Industrial (name TBD)  
**Location:** Austin, TX  
**Type:** In-house panel fabrication shop  
**Outcome:** Not an overflow partner, but data point

---

## Company Profile

**Business:** Electrical motors + motor controls panel builds

**Capacity:** "Just enough" - no overflow work available
- All builds done in-house
- Never outsource work
- No bandwidth for partnerships

---

## Key Insights

**Not a partnership fit:**
- They don't refer overflow (don't have any)
- They don't outsource (internal capability)
- Unlikely to be a customer

**What they're interested in:**
- Line sheet (just for reference/pricing)
- Portal pricing is negotiable (not fixed rates)

**Implication:**
- Shops focused on specific verticals (motors/controls) may not be good overflow partners
- Their "just enough" capacity suggests tight market, not desperation

---

## Data Point

This confirms: Panel shop overflow partnerships are harder to come by than expected.
- Shops are either swamped (can't help you)
- Or doing fine (don't need your help)
- Middle ground (willing to partner) is smaller

## Next Steps

- [ ] Don't pursue as partner (no overflow)
- [ ] Can use as reference (if they're satisfied with your work)
- [ ] Send line sheet as promised
