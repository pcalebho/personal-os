## Key Learnings

### Company Context
- Dad owns Control Associates Inc
- Mason is new engineer "getting his feet wet"
- **Old workforce** - everyone's very old at company
- **15-year relationship** with current panel shop (deeply entrenched)

### Pain Points
- **Lead times CAN be long** → lose reputation
- (But not enough pain to switch suppliers)

### Positive Signals
- **Website attracted him** (proof marketing is working)
- Interest in what we're doing

### Blockers
- **Not the decision maker** (Dad is)
- **15-year supplier relationship** (high switching cost)
- Low urgency

## Strategic Takeaways

**What worked:**
- ✅ Website is generating inbound interest
- ✅ Young engineers are curious about new approaches

**What didn't:**
- ❌ Junior employees rarely have buying power
- ❌ Long-term supplier relationships are sticky
- ❌ Lead time complaints without action = not enough pain

**Lesson:**
- Target decision makers directly (not junior engineers)
- OR: Get junior engineers to champion you internally (longer sales cycle)
- 15-year relationships don't break without major pain

## Follow-Up Strategy

**Low priority, but:**
- Keep Mason on radar for future
- If Dad ever gets frustrated with current shop, Mason knows us
- Potential future hire candidate? (young engineer interested in modern approach)

**Action:**
- Don't invest time chasing this deal
- Add to nurture list (quarterly check-in)
- Focus on decision makers with active pain
