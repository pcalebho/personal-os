### Template 1: General Distributor Inquiry (Quotes + Panel Builder Program)

**Subject:** Panel Shop Partnership Inquiry - [Your Company Name]

Hi,

I'm Caleb Ho, founder of Blitz Panel - we're a UL 508A certified panel shop based in Austin, TX focused on industrial control panels.

I'm reaching out to explore a supplier relationship and learn more about your panel builder program. We're looking for:

- **Competitive pricing** on control components (PLCs, drives, enclosures, terminal blocks)
- **Credit terms** for ongoing orders
- **Technical support** for spec'ing and sourcing

Our typical builds include Allen-Bradley/Rockwell, Siemens, Schneider, and Eaton components depending on customer requirements.

Could you connect me with an automation sales rep or panel builder program contact? Happy to set up a call to discuss our needs in more detail.

Thanks,
Caleb Ho

**Subject:** Joining [Schneider/Eaton] Panel Builder Program

Hi,

I'm interested in joining the [mySchneider Panel Builders / Eaton Panel Builder Power Advantage] program.

We're Blitz Panel, a UL 508A certified control panel shop in Austin, TX. We regularly build panels using [Square D / Eaton] components and want to formalize our relationship to access:

- Program pricing and discounts
- Technical resources and training
- Software tools (configurators, CAD libraries)

Our annual component spend is growing and we're looking for a primary supplier relationship.

What's the best way to get started with the program registration?

Thanks,

   - "Also looking for competitive pricing on automation components going forward"
   - "Interested in your panel builder program if you have one"
   - "Need a distributor who can support quick turnarounds"

3. **Ask about their program:**
   - "Do you have a panel builder or OEM program?"
   - "What does pricing look like for shops our size?"
   - "Do you offer credit terms?"
   - "What brands do you carry for [PLCs/drives/enclosures]?"

4. **Close with next step:**
   - "Can I send over my BOM for a quote?"
   - "What's your turnaround on quotes?"
   - "Can I get set up with an account at the same time?"
   - "Would you send me a credit application?"

### Handling Common Questions

**"Do you have a specific project?"**
> "Yes, I can send over a BOM for quoting. But I'm also looking to set up an ongoing relationship, not just one-off orders."

**"We don't have a formal panel builder program"**
