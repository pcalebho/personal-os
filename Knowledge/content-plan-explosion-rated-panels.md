## Narrative Hook

**"The $150k panel debate: Do you actually need explosion-rated, or are you paying for compliance theater?"**

Explosion-rated (Class I, Division I/II) panels are required for hazardous locations — but most shop owners don't understand the nuances. Result: Either they spec overkill (wasting money) or they spec wrong (creating liability).

---

## The Conflict / Tension Points

1. **The regulation confusion:** Facility thinks they need NFPA Class I because they handle solvents. In reality, their location is Class II (combustible dust). Wrong spec = wasted $80k+.

2. **The cost multiplier:** Explosion-rated components cost 2-5x more. Material sourcing, certification, testing, documentation burden skyrocket.

3. **The liability knife-edge:** Spec too conservative = money burned. Spec too aggressive/loose = you're liable if something goes wrong. Engineers get this wrong constantly.

4. **The lifecycle trap:** Explosion-rated panels need more frequent testing, certification, maintenance. Facilities often don't budget for this ongoing cost.

## Story Structure

**Opening:** Real-world example of facility that spent $200k on explosion-rated panels for a Class II location (or vice versa)

**Why it matters:** 
- Petroleum, chemical, grain processing industries deal with this constantly
- One wrong call costs tens of thousands + potential shutdown liability
- Most panel builders don't have expertise in NFPA/NEC nuances

**The Nuances:**
- What actually triggers each hazard class (gases vs dusts vs vapors)
- Component selection rules (relays, sensors, wiring must all be certified)
- Temperature classifications (T1-T6) and how they affect component choices
- Documentation & inspection requirements (way more complex than standard panels)
- When "non-classified" design + engineering workarounds are smarter than full Class I spec

**The Expert Take:** Interview a facility engineer from petrochemical or grain storage company, or a panel builder who specializes in hazardous locations

**The Lesson:** Proper classification = massive savings. Get it wrong, and you overspend or create liability.

## CTA / Takeaway

"Explosion-rated panels solve a real problem in hazardous industries. But the biggest cost isn't the panels — it's getting the classification right in the first place."

## SME/Interviewee Candidates

- Petrochemical facility engineer
- Grain storage/processing operations manager
- Panel builder specializing in Class I/II locations
- NFPA compliance consultant

## Why This Works

✅ Solves a real decision point (spec right = save huge money)  
✅ Has narrative tension (classify wrong → expensive waste or liability)  
✅ Positions Blitzpanel as expert-minded on complex compliance  
✅ Drives inbound: "explosion rated panels" + industry verticals
