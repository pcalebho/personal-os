# Distributor Call Script

## Context
Need 100 distributor calls Feb 9-14. Script should position as overflow partner.

## Next Actions
- [ ] Write opening (who you are, why calling)
- [ ] Pain point probe (do they get overflow/capacity questions?)
- [ ] Ask: "Do you ever refer panel shops to customers?"
- [ ] Ask: "Would you consider referring to us for overflow?"
- [ ] Close: "Can I send you info?"
- [ ] Test script with 3 calls, refine

## Key Points to Hit
- You're a panel shop (quick turnaround)
- Looking for overflow partnerships
- Want to be their "backup" when they're slammed
- Can quote fast (1-2 hours)

## Progress Log
- 2026-02-08: Task created
