# Panel Shop Call Script

## Context
Need 100 panel shop calls Feb 9-14. Script should position as overflow capacity partner.

## Next Actions
- [ ] Write opening (who you are, why calling)
- [ ] Pain point probe (do they get capacity/timeline questions they can't fill?)
- [ ] Ask: "When you're slammed, who do you refer overflow work to?"
- [ ] Pitch: "We can be your overflow shop. Get them quotes fast."
- [ ] Close: "Can I send you info?"
- [ ] Test script with 3 calls, refine

## Key Points to Hit
- You're a panel fab shop (quick turnaround, quality)
- Looking for overflow partnerships
- Want to take their overflow work when they're busy
- Can quote fast (1-2 hours), deliver in 2-3 weeks
- No competing—you're their backup
