## Context
**Supports Goal:** Sales System (P0) - Customer discovery + pipeline building

**Target:** 100 customer conversations by Feb 19, 2026  
**Daily target:** ~7 conversations/day  
**Tracker:** `/root/.openclaw/workspace/personal-os/Metrics/customer-conversations-feb-2026.md`

## Strategy

**Channels (prioritized):**
1. **LinkedIn** (fast, scalable, visual)
2. **Email** (personalized, async)
3. **Phone** (highest conversion)

**Targets:**
- ECPs (panel shops) - overflow work
- OEMs - equipment manufacturers needing panels
- Integrators - design/build firms
- Distributors - referral partners
- End users (Series A companies) - direct sales

**Daily cadence:**
- Morning: 20-30 LinkedIn connection requests
- Mid-day: Follow up on responses, send 10 personalized emails
