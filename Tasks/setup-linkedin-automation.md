# LinkedIn Automation Setup

## Context
Manual copy/paste of messages is inefficient. Set up automated sequences for bulk outreach.

## Constraints
- LinkedIn blocks bots (can't automate message sending directly)
- Manual connections + messages still required for safety
- BUT: Can automate scheduling, templates, list management

## Next Actions
- [ ] Research LinkedIn automation tools (Dripify, Outreach, Clay, etc.)
- [ ] Check if they integrate with OpenClaw/APIs
- [ ] Define sequences:
  - Connection request (personalized invite)
  - Day 3: Follow-up message (if accepted)
  - Day 7: Product pitch (if engaged)
- [ ] Set up contact lists (100 distributors, 100 shops)
- [ ] Build message templates (3-5 variants per sequence)
- [ ] Test with 5 contacts first (watch for bot detection)

## Notes
- LinkedIn TOS: automation is risky (manual is safer)
- Alternative: Scheduling tool (send at off-hours manually)
- Goal: Reduce friction on bulk outreach

## Progress Log
