# Send landing page to people for critical feedback

## Context
**Supports Goal:** Sales System (P0) - Improve messaging + positioning

- [ ] Draft personal outreach message (explain it's a startup, ask for brutal honesty)
- [ ] Send landing page link with specific questions to focus feedback on
- [ ] Collect responses (Slack, email, call)
- [ ] Summarize feedback themes (messaging, clarity, missing info, trust signals, etc.)
- [ ] Prioritize changes
