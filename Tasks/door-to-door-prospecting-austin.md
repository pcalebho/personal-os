# Door-to-door prospecting in Austin area

## Context
**Supports Goal:** Sales System (P0) - Build repeatable sales motion for 1 panel/week

Exploratory sales channel. In-person visits to local manufacturers/facilities to book tours and pitch services. High-effort but could build strong local relationships.

**Key question:** How do we differentiate from other shops?

## Next Actions
- [ ] Define target businesses (manufacturers, facilities needing control panels)
- [ ] Research prospects in Austin area (create list of 20-30)
- [ ] Create capability sheet/leave-behind material
- [ ] Draft differentiation story (speed? AI-powered? custom/flexible? local advantage?)
- [ ] Create pitch script for tour/meeting asks
- [ ] Plan first round of visits (10-15 prospects)
- [ ] Execute visits and track results
- [ ] Document learnings: conversion rate, objections, what works

## Progress Log
- 2026-02-02: Idea captured - want to try it as sales experiment
