# Get Distributor Pricing for NOV Quote

## Context
Part 1 of NOV example quote. Need exact component costs to build accurate quote.

## Contacts to Reach Out To
- [ ] Reynolds Company (Billy Danford) - ABB/Schneider specialist
- [ ] Automation Direct - commodity baseline pricing
- [ ] Graybar (Aaron Gustafson) - alternative pricing
- [ ] AWC (John Dodge) - if available

## Components to Quote
- [ ] Main power distribution (breakers, disconnects)
- [ ] Control transformers
- [ ] Relays, contactors (per NOV spec)
- [ ] Wire (various gauges) - bulk pricing
- [ ] Terminals, lugs, hardware
- [ ] DIN rail, mounting blocks
- [ ] Cable trunking/management

## Process
- [ ] Pull NOV BOM from spec
- [ ] Email/call distributors with itemized list
- [ ] Get pricing + lead times
- [ ] Compare options (cost vs availability vs quality)
- [ ] Lock in best pricing for quote

## Notes
- Billy can quote in ~1 hour (use him for final verification)
- Automation Direct for baseline commodity pricing
- Lead times matter for quote timeline
