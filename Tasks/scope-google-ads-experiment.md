# Scope Google Ads Experiment

## Context
Low-priority during sales blitz, but perfect for evening work. Define what to test.

## Next Actions
- [ ] Define target audience (OEMs? Integrators? Distributors?)
- [ ] Pick keywords (control panel, panel design, UL 508A, etc.)
- [ ] Set budget ($500-1000/month?)
- [ ] Define success metric (leads, conversations, demo bookings?)
- [ ] Choose landing page (website? custom landing page?)
- [ ] Draft ad copy (3-5 variants)
- [ ] Plan A/B test structure

## Notes
- This is hypothesis testing (not expected to drive huge volume)
- Goal: Learn what messaging resonates
- Can run small + iterate

## Progress Log
- 2026-02-09: Task created - do tonight after work
