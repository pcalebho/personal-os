# NOV Friday Meeting - Slide Deck + Objections

## Context
Meeting Friday Feb 14 to discuss NOV quote. Need polished presentation + objection rebuttals.

## Slide Deck (Deck to build)
- [ ] Title: NOV Project Quote
- [ ] Current process (pain points they described)
- [ ] Your solution (Design-Build approach)
- [ ] Itemized quote breakdown (BOM + labor + freight)
- [ ] Timeline (when delivered, how it saves time)
- [ ] Example 3D visualization (if applicable)
- [ ] Next steps / risk mitigation
- [ ] Q&A slide (objections ready)

## Objections to Prepare
- [ ] "Why should we use you vs [current vendor]?"
  → Answer: Design-Build + faster iteration + no design expertise needed
- [ ] "Cost is higher than shop X"
  → Answer: You're getting engineering + manufacturing, not just build
- [ ] "Lead times are too long"
  → Answer: Compared to what? Our Design-Build is faster than traditional RFP cycle
- [ ] "Do you have references?"
  → Answer: Santiago (warehouse), Control Associates (grandfather call)
- [ ] "What if we need changes?"
  → Answer: We iterate with you, built for change

## Materials Needed
- [ ] Finalized BOM with pricing
- [ ] Freight cost comparison
- [ ] Panel layout/3D visualization
- [ ] Manufacturing instructions (proof of capability)
- [ ] Delivery timeline graphic
