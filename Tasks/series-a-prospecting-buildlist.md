# Series A prospecting - BuildList campaign

## Context
**Supports Goal:** Sales System (P0) - 1 panel/week velocity

Personalized outreach to 5-10 Series A companies that likely need control panels. Test messaging from landing page feedback. Low friction (email), high leverage (pre-qualified buyers).

## Next Actions
- [ ] Filter BuildList for Series A companies in panel-adjacent categories
- [ ] Use AI to identify likely procurement contact at each company
- [ ] Draft personalized email template (1 version for 5, test)
- [ ] Send to 5 companies first week (test, measure response)
- [ ] Track responses + engagement
- [ ] Iterate based on early feedback
- [ ] Scale to larger batch if working
