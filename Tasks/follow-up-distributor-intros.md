# Follow up with distributor intros from Reicher (Rittal)

## Context
**Supports Goal:** Sales System (P0) - Build distributor relationships for overflow work

Reicher promised to connect us with major distributors who have overflow panel work. This is **long-term pipeline** but highest-quality inbound (warm intro from trusted source). Start now while momentum is high.

## Next Actions
- [ ] Confirm which distributors Reicher is introducing
- [ ] Research each distributor (territory, capabilities, volume)
- [ ] Prepare 1-pager on Blitzpanel (capabilities, quality, speed)
- [ ] Wait for Reicher's intro OR proactively reach out mentioning the connection
- [ ] Schedule calls with distributor reps
- [ ] Position as: "We handle overflow work, competitive pricing, fast turnaround"
- [ ] Build relationship (first calls are exploratory, not sales)

## Progress Log
- 2026-02-04: Task created, Reicher intro pending
