# Research Texas Water Show 2026 - booth strategy

## Context
**Supports Goal:** Sales System (P0) - Customer acquisition

Billy Danford (Reynolds) recommended Texas Water Show as major opportunity for panel business in water/wastewater market.

**Event Details:**
- **Dates:** April 27-30, 2026
- **Location:** Austin, TX
- **Status:** 🚨 **SOLD OUT** (waitlist only)
- **Waitlist email:** exhibits@txwater.org

## Challenge
Billy said: "You need to stand out somehow" - can't just show up with generic booth.

## Next Actions
- [ ] Get on waitlist for booth (email exhibits@txwater.org)
- [ ] Research attendee profile (who goes? decision makers?)
- [ ] Brainstorm differentiation strategies:
  - Live panel build demo?
  - 3D visualization on screens?
  - Free panel design consultations?
  - UL certification workshop?
- [ ] Estimate booth cost + ROI
- [ ] Decide: Exhibit vs Attend-only
- [ ] If exhibiting blocked, explore sponsorship options

## Progress Log
- 2026-02-05: Billy recommended, researched dates (sold out, waitlist)
