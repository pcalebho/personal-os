# NOV Quote - Example Document Build

## Context
Create a detailed quote walkthrough for NOV project. This becomes a portfolio piece + proof of concept for Design-Build approach.

## Next Actions - Phase 1: Cost Assembly
- [ ] Contact distributors for component pricing:
  - Power distribution components
  - Schneider/ABB components on quote
  - Wire (gauge, length mapping)
  - Mounting hardware, DIN rail, terminals
- [ ] Map out wire requirements (count, length, gauge per circuit)
- [ ] Calculate cutouts needed (dimensions, tooling)
- [ ] Research freight/shipping options for finished panel

## Next Actions - Phase 2: Document
- [ ] Pull NOV spec/requirements
- [ ] Create itemized BOM with pricing
- [ ] Document panel layout (3D visualization?)
- [ ] Include manufacturing instructions (wire routing, cutout map)
- [ ] Show freight options + timeline
- [ ] Final quote summary + delivery timeline

## Why This Matters
- Demonstrates Design-Build capability (not just execution)
- Shows value-add (spec clarity, cost breakdown, shipping planning)
- Proof of concept for Santiago/similar customers
- Portfolio piece for sales conversations

## Timeline
- Phase 1 (distributor pricing): Feb 9-12 (3 days)
- Phase 2 (document): Feb 12-21 (6 days)

## Progress Log
- 2026-02-09: Task created - P1, potentially high-reward
