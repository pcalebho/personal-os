## Daily Log

### Feb 5, 2026 (Day 1)
**Count:** 3

**Conversations:**
- [X] 2026-02-05 | Santiago (Warehouse/Logistics Company) | Demo call | 🔥 HOT LEAD: No in-house panel design expertise. Currently outsources to cheapest bidder → panel shop redlines drawings. 3D viz + auto manufacturing instructions impressed. Wants pre-built enclosures (cutouts, trunking, DIN rail). 12-20 panels/year. Follow up: pitch to management. (See Knowledge/santiago-warehouse-logistics-feb5.md)
- [X] 2026-02-05 | Mason Briggs (Control Associates Inc) | Call | Junior engineer, not decision maker. 15-yr shop relationship. Website attracted him. Low probability.
- [X] 2026-02-05 | Grandfather (Control Associates Inc) | Call | 🔥 INSIGHT: Engineering time is bottleneck, not build speed. Values collaborative shops who fill design gaps. 4-6 panels/mo. Demo scheduled.

### Feb 9, 2026 (Day 4)
**Count:** 3

**Conversations:**
- [X] 2026-02-09 | Guardian Industrial (Austin - panel shop) | Call | Overflow limited (just enough). All in-house builds, never outsource. Not partnership fit. Focus: motors, controls.
- [X] 2026-02-09 | Tesla Team (Gigafactory Texas) | Call | 🔥 MAJOR: Bill Palmer (Controls Design Lead) + team. Demoed web app + component library. Currently vendor-locked, NDA required. Follow-up Feb 23-24 for competitive quote. Potential high-value OEM customer.
- [X] 2026-02-09 | Fred (Denali AI - Warehouse/Logistics) | Call | 🔥 HOT: Warehouse systems OEM. 3-4 designs, 1,500+ panels 2025. Multi-sourcing to reduce risk. Want in-house design capability. Paid pilot: $600/yr vs Eplan $1,500. Follow-up Monday same time. NDA process, send design for review. (See Knowledge/fred-denali-ai-feb9.md)

### Feb 6, 2026 (Day 2)
**Count:** 4

**Conversations:**
- [X] 2026-02-06 | Billy Danford (Reynolds Company) | Inbound call | Callback on SPA discussion. SPA ~2mo timeline. Fast quoting (1hr). Texas Water Show interest.
- [X] 2026-02-06 | Richard Garza (ATI - Process Control Engineer II) | Call | 🔥 INSIGHT: Cross-team coordination + component lead times are the real bottleneck. Wrangling IO lists from different teams painful. Cost-driven vendor selection (unless deadline pressure). Will connect with colleague Jonathan for deeper conversation.
- [X] 2026-02-06 | Dylan Rose (American Terawatt) | Call | Power generation co entering data centers. Multi-level control panel architecture (pod/building/site). Component substitution + compliance complexity. Early stage, not ready for detailed specs yet. Will reconnect when ready.
- [X] 2026-02-06 | Fouad (Mariana Minerals) | Call | Series A mining tech company. RFP process painful (extensive back-and-forth). Building in-house (pilot) vs outsource to international vendors (commercial). Bypass UL for speed. Opportunity: Full design-build for repetitive builds (breweries, etc.). (See Knowledge/fouad-mariana-minerals-feb6.md)
