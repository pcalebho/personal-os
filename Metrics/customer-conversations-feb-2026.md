## Daily Log

### Feb 5, 2026 (Day 1)
**Count:** 3

**Conversations:**
- [X] 2026-02-05 | Warehouse/Logistics Company (name TBD) | Video call | Demo shown, interested in pre-built panels + design elimination. 12-20 panels/year. Follow up: quote + pitch to management
- [X] 2026-02-05 | Mason Briggs (Control Associates Inc) | Call | Junior engineer, not decision maker. 15-yr shop relationship. Website attracted him. Low probability.
- [X] 2026-02-05 | Grandfather (Control Associates Inc) | Call | 🔥 INSIGHT: Engineering time is bottleneck, not build speed. Values collaborative shops who fill design gaps. 4-6 panels/mo. Demo scheduled.

### Feb 6, 2026 (Day 2)
**Count:** 3

**Conversations:**
- [X] 2026-02-06 | Billy Danford (Reynolds Company) | Inbound call | Callback on SPA discussion. SPA ~2mo timeline. Fast quoting (1hr). Texas Water Show interest.
- [X] 2026-02-06 | Richard Garza (ATI - Process Control Engineer II) | Call | 🔥 INSIGHT: Cross-team coordination + component lead times are the real bottleneck. Wrangling IO lists from different teams painful. Cost-driven vendor selection (unless deadline pressure). Will connect with colleague Jonathan for deeper conversation.
- [X] 2026-02-06 | Dylan Rose (American Terawatt) | Call | Power generation co entering data centers. Multi-level control panel architecture (pod/building/site). Component substitution + compliance complexity. Early stage, not ready for detailed specs yet. Will reconnect when ready. (See Knowledge/dylan-rose-american-terawatt-feb6.md)
